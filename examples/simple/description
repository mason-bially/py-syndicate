This is a simple example of a command line program which parses a file and then performs some operation on the data parsed out of the file. The files contain employee information. The operations are as follows:

list: Lists the names of the employees.
managers: Lists all managers and the employees they manage and the employees they manage (hierarchical). Then lists unmanaged employees.
info [name]: Lists the information (name, salary, manager) for an employee.
payroll: Totals the salaries and prints the total money needed for a month.
stats: lists a bunch of statistics about all of the employees, average salary, managers (and average salary, average people managed), non-managers (and average salary)

== Data Format ==
This first line has a number indicating the number of employees.
Subsequent line should be blank (not indicating an employee), start with # (indicating a comment), or contain an employee

Each employee line should look like:
Full Name,$40_000,Manager Name
    Where the second entry is a dollar amount in integer format, (Note that the integer parser should support characters like $,._ but commas are split for the record so _ is used instead). The third entry is the manager and may be blank, but the trailing comma still needs to be there.
    Managers must come before the people they manage in the list.

Example files are:
a.data
b.data
c.fuzzy.data
a.error.data
b.error.data

The implementation should be built as follows:
Each command should be a function.
There should be shared functions which parse the file, and build the management hierarchy
Each employee should be a struct
